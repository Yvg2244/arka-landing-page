      <p>
        At Review Academy, we began our journey in May 2021 by managing social
        media for companies and teaching digital marketing basics. As we grew,
        we recognized the many challenges businesses often face in finding
        diverse talent for various needs, leading to management issues and
        inefficiencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, we founded Arka Consultancy. Our goal is to be a
        one-stop solution for all your business needs. Our team of experts in
        every department is dedicated to understanding and fulfilling your
        requirements. With Arka Consultancy, you can enjoy peace of mind knowing

            <p>
              <strong>Introduction:</strong><br><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">EliteGroup Finances</span> started with a simple but in-demand service, ‘Company’s financial audits’. The
                company had been an offline firm for quite a while and they were looking for online expansion. So
                when we received their lead, we knew we had a real opportunity to showcase the skills we have
                acquired over a period of 1.5 years. We had an opportunity to take a completely off-the-grid
                company to the vast world of digital media</p>
              <br><br>
              <strong>Challenges:</strong><br><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                Transitioning from an offline to an online business model presented several challenges for EliteGroup Finances:
              </p><br>
              <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Limited Online Presence:</strong> Initially, the company had minimal digital footprint, lacking a website, social media presence, and online marketing strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Expertise:</strong> Lack of in-house expertise in website development, SEO, branding, and digital marketing posed a significant hurdle.</li>

                <li><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong> The financial auditing sector was increasingly competitive online, requiring a strategic approach to stand out.</li>
              </ol>

                Arka (then Revibe) was engaged to facilitate EliteGroup Finances' transition to the digital realm. The partnership involved a comprehensive strategy to establish and enhance the company’s online presence:

            <h2>Fulfilling every coffee lover's dream</h2><br>
            <p>
              <strong>Introduction:</strong><br><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                Mr Mboso started as a software engineer but soon realised entrepreneurship was his true calling.
He approached us after observing us on Instagram, telling us that he liked our designs and would
like to offer us some work. He explained to us that he wanted his Instagram page to attract people
and get them interested in his website where he sold coffee. He didn’t share much about his
business model as the only service he was looking for was designing his Instagram posts. So, he
gave us specific ideas and we started working on design. We provided him with a few options, and
he finalized on a certain design. We started making posts for him and it went on for a few weeks. <br>
There was an impressive rise in his following and likes and we thought everything was going fine.
But, one day out of nowhere, Mboso told us he no longer needed our services. This came as a big
shock to us as everything was going great. We wanted to know the reason behind this, so we asked
Mboso for an online meeting. Mboso agreed and there he told us what was wrong.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <strong>Challenges:</strong><br><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                While working as a software engineer, amidst the hum of technology and the glow of computer
screens, Mboso found solace in a simple pleasure: coffee. He was not your typical office coffee
lover. He went every year to Ethiopia to bring the best coffee beans and brewed them himself in his
expensive brewing machine. While his hands and mind worked monotonously writing codes, when
that aroma of coffee filled his nostrils, when the cup came to his sight and when the taste of coffee
reached his tongue, he became alive! Moboso knew, that writing codes wasn’t something he could
do for long but the ever-present question of “what then?” still hovered over his head. <br> <br>
One rainy evening as Mboso was enjoying the perfect sips of his self-brewed coffee watching the
rain outside, a flash of lightning struck the sky and so did an idea in Moboso’s head. He finally knew
what he had to do! He decided to become an entrepreneur and sell coffee. He soon quit his job and
with his savings, started brewing the first batch of “Mboso’s Taste”. As he hired people to set up a
website and listed his products online, his savings soon started to puff away. <br><br>
But as you know, the world is not all sweets and greenery. Mboso, at the start, was steady with his
sales but soon everything slowed down. So Mboso thought about attracting more clients through
social media but had no idea how things worked. He thought making attractive posts about his
coffee was enough to generate traffic to his website, but as the story played itself, that wasn’t the
case. After listening to all this, we knew we could help. He needed services that we had and that
was the only way to save a dream, to save a person who otherwise would have to go back to
something that pushed him to the edge. <br><br>
             </p>
              <br><br>
              <strong>Our Approach:</strong><br><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">It was a new challenge for us. We had never worked with a foreign client before. We knew the
                required skill set but the target audience in this case had to be understood well.</p><br>
              <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> We started with research and figured out what made Mboso’s coffee better than the already available options in their market.</li>
                <li><strong>Selling the Story:</strong> We decided that Mboso’s story itself was an amazing selling point. The few minutes of luxury of sipping coffee between deadlines and lengthy codes was not just Mboso’s thing. We just needed people to understand that they deserved a coffee which was worth the work they did whole day. A luxury, if you may. We pitched the idea to Mboso and he gave us a green flag.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Content Strategy:</strong> Next, we built a content strategy that revolved around the idea of coffee being a luxury to savour and be enjoyed like it is supposed to be. Mboso’s story was circulated in various forms which helped people to relate.</li>
                <li><strong>Backend Development & Paid Advertisement:</strong> Our backend work of engagement, SEO and res-continued. We also ran Instagram ads and targeted office workers.</li>
              </ol>
              <br><br>
              <strong>Results:</strong><br>
              <ul style="margin-left: 40px; color: black; list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>After the 1st week of running our social media campaign, there was an enormous rise in website traffic but the leads and conversions were still low.</li>
                <li>After making a few changes and applying what we learned in the first week, the second week turned out to be a success with a 25% increase in lead generation and a 10% increase in product sale.</li>
                <li>These numbers kept rising as we continued and Mboso Enterprises was a success.</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                Mboso’s case was a matter of huge learning for us. We understood how stories sold more than
products. It also gave us great insights into foreign audiences and business workflow. This also
taught us that people with small businesses and startups can do wonders if guided by someone
who knows how to get things done.

              <strong>Introduction:</strong><br><br>  
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                Sharp Eye Solution Company (SESC) is a digital security firm specializing in providing advanced cybersecurity solutions to businesses of all sizes. Established with the mission to enhance digital safety and protect organizations from cyber threats, SESC initially faced challenges in effectively reaching and acquiring new clients despite its innovative services.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <strong>Challenges:</strong><br><br>
              <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
                Despite offering cutting-edge digital security services, SESC struggled with its marketing efforts.
The company's groundbreaking ideas and robust cybersecurity solutions were not effectively
communicated to potential clients. This resulted in a lack of visibility in the competitive
cybersecurity market and hindered their growth prospects. <br><br>
Recognizing the need to revamp its marketing strategy and enhance client acquisition, SESC
solicited Arka Consultancy.
              </p>

The app provided clients with convenient access to cybersecurity resources, real-time threat alerts, and secure communication channels, enhancing client engagement and service delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>AI-Powered Marketing Strategies:</strong> Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, Arka implemented data-driven marketing strategies for SESC.

                This success of Arka Consultancy had us thinking that it was time to expand. So, in June 2024, we switched our business model from freelance work to a full-time employee-based company. Hence, the process of hiring experts and interns started.

            <h2>Increasing sales of SalesUp!</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
      This is the case of SalesUp, an Indian startup with a vision to revolutionize affiliate marketing. The startup owners were already trying for a year before they approached us. They were trying to build a social media profile but it was a mess. As they told us about their goals, we started analyzing their social media. They wanted to generate leads through social media.<br><br>
    </p>
      <strong>Challenges:</strong><br><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
      We figured out the problems they were having. They were the following:<br>
    </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; color: black;list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>Their posts weren't niche-specific.</li>
      <li>They didn't have any branding whatsoever.</li>
      <li>They had no theme in colour or design.</li>
      <li>They did no engagement whatsoever.</li>
      <li>There was no content strategy.</li>
      <li>The posts were not informative and eye-grabbing.</li>
      <li>There was no regularity in posting.</li> 
    </ul>
      <br>
      <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
      And a few more.</p> <br><br><br>
      <strong>Our Approach:</strong> <br><br>
      <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
      <li><strong>New Strategies:</strong> We made new social media strategies for them and started experimenting. We understood their ideal audience and framed our strategies accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Branding:</strong> We specifically designed posts for them and with their approval, chose the branding
        colours and designs. At first, they were dubious about us. We changed things and that is alwaysa pain point. But we asked them to trust us and give us some time. </li>
      <li><strong>Content Strategy:</strong> With this, we made a content strategy for a week and developed a few posts. These posts were informative and explained what affiliate marketing is and its various factors.</li>
      <li><strong>Developing a CTA:</strong> They lacked a Call-to-action in their posts. They simply used to put in their phone numbers. But we changed that to directing potential leads towards their website.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media Management:</strong> There were other improvements like story posting, DMs and engaging with followers and other creators.</li><br><br>
    </ol>
      <strong>Results:</strong><br><br>
      <ul style="margin-left: 40px; color: black;list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Within a week of rebranding and changing their social media, their followers increased and so
          did their likes and comments. But they weren’t happy with the results. Their goal was lead
          generation, not to gain followers and accumulate likes. But we reassured them that it was part oour strategy. Engagement is the first step towards lead generation. This was the time of make obreak. But SalesUp chose to trust us and give us more time. This decision turned out to be a
          breakthrough for them.</li>
          <li>Within the next two weeks, their lead generation saw a massive rise of 300% and their
            conversions also increased by 100%.</li>
            <li>They had 150 people working with them before our services and after a month of working with
              us, they had a network of 500+ people.</li>
      </ul><br>
      <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br><br>
      <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
      These specific strategies for things that most people ignore and that SalesUp was ignoring too,
helped the company to get to new heights fast. <br> 
This is one out of many success stories that we were a part of, as Revibe Academy. <br><br>
As months passed by, we started getting offers from foreign startups as well. This brought us a new
challenge. These companies required services, ideas, and methods that were different from the
Indian startup space. This helped us broaden our vision. One such company was Mboso
Enterprises. </p>
